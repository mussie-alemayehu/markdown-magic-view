## üöÄ Getting Started

**Option 1: Live Demo (Optional)**

* Check out the live version here: [Link to your live demo - e.g., deployed on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages] *(Add this if you deploy it)*

**Option 2: Running Locally**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO
    ```
2.  **Open the HTML file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

That's it! No complex build steps required for the basic functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Input Listener:** JavaScript listens for the `input` event on the `<textarea>`.
2.  **Markdown Conversion:** On input, the text content is passed to `marked.parse()`.
3.  **HTML Output:** The resulting HTML string updates the `innerHTML` of the output `<div>`.
4.  **Syntax Highlighting:** `hljs.highlightAll()` is typically called after the HTML is updated to apply highlighting to relevant code blocks. Editor highlighting might be handled separately depending on the specific integration method.
5.  **Theming:** CSS variables are defined for colors, fonts, etc. A JavaScript function toggles a class on the `<body>` or root element, which activates the different variable sets for Light/Dark themes.
6.  **Shortcuts:** Keyboard event listeners detect `Ctrl/Cmd` key combinations and manipulate the textarea's selection/value accordingly.
7.  **Drag & Drop:** Event listeners (`dragover`, `drop`) handle file drops, read the `.md` file using the FileReader API, and update the textarea.
8.  **Scroll Sync:** Scroll event listeners on both panes calculate proportional scroll positions and update the `scrollTop` property of the other pane.
